# DEMD-formats
Reverse engineering of DE:MD game resources formats

The game Deus Ex: Mankind Divided was released in late summer 2016.
However, until now, there are practically no mods for it.

One of the reasons was the use of Denuvo, however a few months ago the game was added to the GOG store with DRM removed.  
So now is the time to parse the device file formats and (possibly) write mods for the game.
